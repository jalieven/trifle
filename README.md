Massive scalable REST based asynchronous web crawler

TODO
----
- Split up functionality for not downloading but fetching data and structuring it in ES
- Think about an easy way of grouping images export -> zips -> python?
- Make attribute conditionals for the DownloadListener
- Akka cluster integration
- D3.js UI for visualizing agent-hierarchy (bigger means more messages) with WebSockets
- Operational UI (seed sending (still to implement: save requests), download switch, store heave and delete)
- UrlFetcher MDC url
